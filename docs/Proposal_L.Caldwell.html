    <h1>Emissions During the Covid-19 Pandemic</h1>
    <p>This map is important is relevant to what has become our new "normal". Covid-19 has been a relatively new illness ever since the first case in 2020 Wuhan, China. Scientists have still been trying to figure out this deadly disease and trying to find a cause. It can also tie in to our emission rates. Ever since majority of the world went into a nationwide or statewide lockdown, we were not able to go about our everyday lives anymore. Therefore, most of our emissions declined dramatically. Climate change has been an increasing topic of discussion years prior as our world continues to heat up. Could this deadly disease turnout to help global warming start to reverse?</p>
    <ol>
        <li><i class="heading">Describing the Purpose of the Map</i>In this map project, I will be looking/exploring at the global greenhouse gas emissions during the COVID-19 pandemic. As well as that being the main point of the project, I will also see how the emissions could have maybe related to income and population. This map will solely focus in the state of Ohio. This map is intended for a general public audience. It might be more of an interest for those that reside in the state of Ohio. As well as any scientists or geographers who are curious in knowing what the emissions did during this time. I decided to do my map project on this topic becuase it relates to my capstone research. In our capstone, we are looking at three most populous countries- China, India, and the United States. In that case, I am learning alot about them. In this project, I will be learning alot more of what happened in the state of Ohio. I live here and so it would be very interesting to see how the emissions changed in the state I live in. I hope at the end, the interactivity of this map can be of one where you can click on a specific city or county and see their total emissions or their contribution percentage of the states total. As well as seeing that city or counties total population and average household income.</li>
        <li><i class="heading">The Structure of the Map</i> I am thinking of using the isarithmic technique for this map preject. If I cannot find a specific amount of how much this city/county produced in emissions, it will most likely just be an overview for the state of Ohio's emissions. Emissions are much more continuous in that aspect as well and would be hard to pinpoint a specific location. In regards to how I will be providing data to the viewer, I will probably do a graph showing the relationships between the the cities/counties population and average household. With this they can see that relationship, as well as be able to see on the isartihmic map how much they contributed to the states emissions. In the ancillary text, it will cotain more information on the overall state of Ohio and it's contribution to the total United States emissions. As well as, I can talk about the top 3 populous cities/counties and top 3 smalles cities/counties and see the difference maybe.</li>
        <li><i class="heading">Data Sources</i> The information and data will come from carbon monitor. Carbon monitors data scales from 2019 to 2021. This is where I will be able to get the monthly data seperated by sectors. On this site, I can also download emissions for the other countries- India and China- not just the US.The latest update of carbon monitor was August 20th, 2021. This site is an estimate of global emissions during COVID-19 since usually it takes a few years to actually get that data. They got their monthly estimate data from the EIA's energy data and daily estimate emissions as well from the EIA but at a state-level.Regarding the population and average household income, I have not looked up that data just yet. Most likely I will get that from the U.S. Census. Now that I am thinking about it, hopefully they will have that information up.</li>
        <li><i class="heading">Methodology</i> I am not entirely sure on how I will go about this process of processing my data. I am pretty sure, I will start off by collecting my data and for the United States. I will probably have to incorporate my learning from Cart. 1 by singling out Ohio. As well as population as a layer and the average household income. After that, I will probably move to Carto Maps and do some editing in there. The editing will probably include fixing numbers inside the legend (population, fixing income to not have decimals, etc), rearranging it, etc.</li>
        <li><i class="heading">Timeframe</i> My timeframe goal, hopefully that I will be staying on track, will be to start on October 4th starting with finding my data. I have most of the data collected regarding emissions, but not for average household income and population. Hopefully I will be done with that by the 13th. I will start my Data Processing October 11th and finish with that on the 20th. Start my design of the map on the 21st. Hopefully be done with that by the 27th of October. Then I will start my actual map production on November 1st. I will do this for the rest of the time because I know I will need a lot of time for this specific part of the project. So I will have enough time to ask questions and be so rushed.</li>
